# crypto-finder (2019)
Tool to find current information on the most important cryptos. 



## First Version.           FINISHED

A Python program that uses oop implementation to scrape coindesk.com and finds the current bitcoin price. The main file imports from another that contains the classes into a function that manages the different currencies and instantiates every one of them. 

## Second Version.          FINISHED

The same python program but now you set a max price and a min price. The thing I realized is that I was really constraining myself with some coins, when I could really just set the chosen coin as the input and let the class handle that instead of setting options and if statements. So what I'm trying to say, is that in this version now you can use any coin that is in the coindesk database and the options are just examples now. 

## Third Version. 

This third version will include notifications (so the set max and min option is actually useful for something) and some minor changes to the platforms workings. 

## Fourth Version. 

This fourth version will implement Tkinter on top of everything to create a fully functional GUI instead of using the command line for every step. 
(probably the final version of the project)
