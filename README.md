# crypto-finder
Tool to find current information on the most important cryptos. 



## First version.           FINISHED

A Python program that uses oop implementation to scrape coindesk.com and finds the current bitcoin price. The main file imports from another that contains the classes into a function that manages the different currencies and instantiates every one of them. 

## Second version.          FINISHED

The same python program but now you set a max price and a min price. The thing I realized is that I was really constraining myself with some coins, when I could really just set the chosen coin as the input and let the class handle that instead of setting options and if statements. So what I'm trying to say, is that in this version now you can use any coin that is in the coindesk database and the options are just examples now. 

### Third Version   <=== We're here right now

The user could now ask the program to notify in a desktop notification when a coin hits a certain price. 

## Fourth version and final version 

Add Tkinter GUI. (This is probably the most complicated step because I'm not really fluent in tkinter and it's a full blown interface) 

(Hope final version happens by the end of January)
